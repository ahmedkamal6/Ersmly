Ersmly is a web application that uses DALLE from open ai to generate images from text using  their API    
i used onrender to host my node server and netlify to host my react app here is a DEMO
user auth and delete button will be implemented later

DEMO :https://ersmly.netlify.app/ just refresh page if it didn't work first time i guess it's netlify problem but not sure

Edit: authentication and delete are done, auto uses name for posting
